# Distributed-Node-Network-Topology
This project was created as the second assignment for COP-5615 taught by Prof. Alin Dobra at University of Florida. The project is implemented in Erlang and makes use of multi-core systems to connect nodes in a given topology and exchange messages between them using Gossip and Push-Up Algorithms.
